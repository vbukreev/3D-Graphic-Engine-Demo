# 3D-Graphic-Engine-Demo

Setted up the project, where I had to find all vertices and triangles. Perfomred calculations of 3D coordinates to be converted into on-screen 2D coordinates using a projection matrix. This results in seeing a cube being rotated in 2-axis and translated. 
The current version contain bugs, hence no display of the object yet. In the process of debugging and testing.
