# 3D-Graphic-Engine-Demo

I set up the project, where I had to find all vertices and triangles. I performed calculations of 3D coordinates to be converted into on-screen 2D coordinates using a projection matrix. This results in seeing a cube being rotated in two axes and translated. 
I am integrating OpenGL graphics library to have a visual display (GLFW as a static library). 
The current version contains bugs, so the object has not been displayed yet. I am currently in the process of debugging and testing.
